        "1) What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python is a high level general purpose programming language known for its simplicity.readibility and versatility created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.It is used in a versatile manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- It is a program that reads and executes python code line by line.\n",
        "  Commonly used interpreters are CPython,PyPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Predefined keywords in python are the reserved words that have special meaning in the language.These keywords are used to define syntax and structures,we cannot use them as variable names.\n",
        "        \n",
        "4)Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    - No, keywords can't be used as variable names.\n",
        "        \n",
        "5)What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability refers to whether the value of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - List are designed for flexibility.We often need to change,add or remove items Whereas tuples are designed for fixed,stable data like coordinates,setting, or values that shouldn't change.\n",
        "- List need more overhead to support operations like append(),remove(),etc whereas tuples use less memory and are faster than list.\n",
        "    \n",
        " 7)What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - '==' checks if the value of two variables are equal and compares the content whereas 'is' operatorchecks if both variables point to the same object in memory and compares identity,not value.\n",
        "  \n",
        "8)What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logic operators are used to combine conditional statements and return True or False based on logical relationship.Examples- and, or, not.\n",
        "        \n",
        "9) What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Typecasting means converting one datat type into another, such as from a string to an integer or a float to a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "10)What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit typecasting is done automatically, error chances are low.It helps in combining like (int+float) whereas explicit typecasting is done manually which might cause error.It is used to change input/output type.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditional Statements are used to make decisions in a program.They let our code perform different actions depending on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "  12) How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif statement in python means else if.It is used to check multiple conditions one after another-if the first condition is false, Python checks the next one.\n",
        "\n",
        "  13)What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - For Loop- It works for making sequence,it is used when number of iterations is known.\n",
        "  While Loop- It works as long as the condition is True,also used when number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "      \n",
        "  14)Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - If we are building a login system that asks the user to enter the correct password, username then it is highly preferred to use while loop.\n"
